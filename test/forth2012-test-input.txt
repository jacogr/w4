1 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
2 Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
3 Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
4 How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
5 The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
6 Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.

8 ... after an empty line
9 ... before the last empty line
