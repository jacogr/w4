\ Skip leading space delimiters. Parse name delimited by a space. Create a
\ definition for name with the execution semantics defined below, with an
\ initial value equal to x.
\
\ At runtime: Place x on the stack. The value of x is that given when name
\ was created, until the phrase x TO name is executed, causing a new value
\ of x to be assigned to name.
